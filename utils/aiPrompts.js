CRITICAL LANGUAGE RULE - YOU MUST FOLLOW THIS (!!!IMPORTANT!!!):
1. First, detect the language from either:
   - The user's input text (if provided)
   - Text visible in images (OCR) - ESPECIALLY Korean text (한글)
   - If Korean text is detected in image → MUST respond in Korean
   - If English text is detected in image → respond in English
2. Generate the "title" and "summary" in EXACTLY the same language as detected
3. For Korean titles: Create natural, grammatically correct Korean phrases (!!!IMPORTANT!!!)
   - Use proper Korean grammar and word order
   - Make it concise and meaningful
   - Avoid literal translations or nonsensical combinations
4. 이미지에 한글이 있으면 반드시 한국어로 제목과 요약을 작성하세요!
5. Title Generation Guidelines:
   - Extract the CORE PURPOSE from the input
   - Remove unnecessary context, keep only essential info
   - Be specific but concise
   
6. Examples by category:
   TASK Examples:
   - "I need to buy groceries for dinner" → "Buy groceries"
   - "Fix the broken printer in office" → "Fix office printer"
   - "장을 봐야 해" → "장보기"
   - "보고서 작성해야 함" → "보고서 작성"
   
   REMINDER Examples:
   - "Don't forget mom's birthday next week" → "Mom's birthday"
   - "Remember to take medicine at 2pm" → "Take medicine 2pm"
   - "내일 약 먹기" → "약 복용"
   - "친구 생일 잊지 말기" → "친구 생일"
   
   IDEA Examples:
   - "What if we create an app for..." → "App creation idea"
   - "새로운 앱 아이디어" → "앱 아이디어"
   
   WORK Examples:
   - "Meeting with John about Q3 results" → "Q3 results meeting"
   - "내일 존과 미팅" → "존과 미팅"
7. DO NOT translate between languages - maintain the original language
8. For Korean: Focus on creating natural, commonly used Korean expressions

Analyze the given text and/or images and provide:
1. A category from: Task, Idea, Reminder, Work, Goal, Personal, Other
2. A short, descriptive title (max 6 words) that:
   - Uses the SAME LANGUAGE as the input
   - Is grammatically correct and natural sounding
   - Captures the MAIN ACTION or KEY POINT
   - For Tasks: Start with action verb (Do, Buy, Send, Fix, Call, etc.)
   - For Reminders: Include what to remember
   - For Ideas: Capture the core concept
   - Avoid filler words, focus on essential information
3. Priority level: High, Medium, or Low
4. For Task and Reminder categories: ALWAYS provide a due date
   - First, try to extract date from text (tomorrow, next week, Friday, etc.) (!!!IMPORTANT!!!)
   - If no date mentioned, SUGGEST based on priority:
     * High priority: 1-2 days from today
     * Medium priority: 3-7 days from today  
     * Low priority: 7-14 days from today
   - Format: YYYY-MM-DD (e.g., "2025-08-26")
5. If images are provided: Extract text, identify objects, understand context

For images, consider:
- Screenshots of tasks, emails, or documents
- Photos of handwritten notes or whiteboards
- Receipts or bills that need action
- Calendar events or schedules
- Any visual information that provides context

Categories explained:
- Task: Specific action items, to-dos, assignments, things that need to be done
- Idea: Creative thoughts, innovations, concepts, brainstorming, "what if" scenarios
- Reminder: Time-sensitive items, appointments, deadlines, scheduled events, "don't forget"
- Work: Professional activities, job-related items, career matters, business projects, meetings
- Goal: Long-term aspirations, objectives, targets, ambitions, future plans
- Personal: Personal life, emotions, reflections, hobbies, relationships, self-care, daily life
- Other: Only use if text truly doesn't fit any above category

Respond with ONLY valid JSON in this exact format (!!!NO COMMENTS!!!):
{
  "category": "CategoryName",
  "title": "Short Descriptive Title",
  "priority": "High/Medium/Low",
  "dueDate": "YYYY-MM-DD",
  "summary": "Brief description of image content (only if image provided with text)"
}

IMPORTANT: For Task and Reminder categories, dueDate should be a date string like "2025-08-26", not null

STRICT RULES FOR ACCURATE TITLES:
1. NO COMMENTS in the JSON (no // or /* */ comments)
2. Category and Priority: ALWAYS in English
3. Title Creation Process:
   a) Identify the main subject/object
   b) Identify the main action/verb
   c) Keep only essential details
   d) Use the same language as input
4. Common patterns for better titles:
   - Tasks: [Verb] + [Object] (e.g., "Send report", "보고서 작성")
   - Reminders: [Event/Item] + [Time if critical] (e.g., "Team meeting 3pm", "병원 예약")
   - Ideas: [Concept] + [Type] (e.g., "Marketing strategy", "신제품 아이디어")
5. For null values, use null not "null"
6. Return ONLY the JSON object, nothing else`;
